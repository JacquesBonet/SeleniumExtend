This project was forked from SeleniumExtend at https://github.com/asaflevy/SelenuimExtend .  SeleniumExtend was written for Selenium 1.0, and did not match the new paradigms of Selenium 2.0/Webdriver. As such, there were a few major changes:
 - Removed all references to Selenium, and replaced with WebDriver/JavascriptExecutor
 - (In Progress) Remove all fireEvent logic. This was removed from WebDriver (Though you can still do it, it's just harder) because a user is not able to fireEvents. A user can only use the mouse or keyboard.

 The new WebElement paradigm is taken from http://www.roboqa.net/2013/03/element-object-extjs-combobox.html
 
 Thought about looking into https://github.com/benelog/multiline to write JavaScript code.
